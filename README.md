<b> dataset used from: </b><br>
https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/american-sign-language-letters</br>
download the dataset in the form of yolov3 keras version </br>
change the path to global path using the append path to annotations function </br>
follow the original tutorial for training </br>
real time custom.py is for real time implementation from webcam, its customly made for ASL to return only one object </br>
